# App-to-report-drug-trafficking-related-crimes-anonymously
Currently, no such platform exists that prioritizes the user’s  privacy and keeps the informant’s details confidential. 
This app will provide a standalone platform for reporting illicit drug  trafficking evidence anonymously. 
The informant’s identity will be kept anonymous at every stage.  We will not be considering sensitive personal information such as  name, address, phone number etc. The login functionality will only  utilize the username (unique) and password which will be used as  reference to check the nature of evidence and threshold of drug  finding reports. 

 Evidence provided will be evaluated on the basis of:
1. Text-based (Fake websites, Missing information, 
Frequency of highlighted words)

2. Image-based (Barcode, Vehicle no. Plate, Pills 
Registration no. and Prescription, Drug color and packaging, 
ammunition and other relevant background details)
